# Case 2: Multimodal Smart Alarm

In the second case multimodal smart alarm is evaluated by computing the average KLM estimate. The alarm can be controlled with three types of modalities: tactile, hand gestures and speech. Sensor error which affect state transitions can be set for each modality.

There are three types of errors: 
    * Recognition error : Command is not recognized (system does nothing)
    * Confusion error : Command is recognized as another command within the same modality.
    * User error : Error caused by the user.
